### 🐛 Bugs 报告

本节指导您提交 LinuxGSM 的错误报告。遵循这些准则有助于维护人员和社区理解您的报告📝，重现行为💻，并找到相关报告🔎.

在创建错误报告之前，请检查 [此列表](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/linuxgsm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting-a-bug-report) ，因为您可能会发现不需要创建错误报告。当你创建一个错误报告，请 [包括尽可能多的细节](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/linuxgsm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) 。填写 [所需的模板]([https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/issues/new/choose)) ，它要求的信息可以帮助我们更快地解决问题。

#### 提交错误报告之前

* **检查 [文档](https://docs.linuxgsm.com)**。你也许能找到问题的原因，自己解决问题。
* **检查问题是否与指向其他支持选项的链接的支持页[**支持页**](https://linuxgsm/com/support) 无关**
* **查看**[**支持页**](https://linuxgsm/com/support) 以获取指向其他支持选项的链接。
* **执行** [**粗略搜索**](https://github.com/search?q=org:GameServerManagers%20type:issues&type=Issues) 以查看是否已报告问题。如果有，但问题仍然存在，请在现有问题上添加评论，并对其竖起大拇指，而不是打开新问题。

#### 我如何提交（良好）错误报告？

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in [the issues form](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/issues/new/choose).

#### 提交游戏服务器请求之前

* **Check for existing** [**game server requests**](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/labels/type%3A%20game%20server%20request) to see if the new game server has already been suggested. If it has **and if the new game server is still open**, give it a thumbs.

### 🎮 游戏服务器特定问题

LinuxGSM is a management script that acts as a wrapper around game servers. These game servers are developed by different game developers such as Valve, Epic and Facepunch to name a few.

LinuxGSM has no control over the development and limited knowledge of issues directly relating to the game servers themselves. The same also applies for any mods, add-ons, maps etc.

If there is an issue with a specific game server or mod the best action may be to contact the game/mod developers on there support forums. If it is unclear some community members should be able to help.

A [list](https://docs.linuxgsm.com/support/game-server) of known game developer forums is available on the [LinuxGSM docs](https://docs.linuxgsm.com/support/game-server).

## 💻 代码贡献

### 拉取请求

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain LinuxGSM quality.
* Fix problems that are important to users.
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible LinuxGSM.
* Enable a sustainable system for LinuxGSM maintainers to review contributions.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1.  Follow all check-list in [the template](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md)
2.  Follow the [style guides](#styleguides)
3.  After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

What if the status checks are failing? If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied before having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

#### 拉取请求命名约定

When naming a pull request to ensure that it is following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standards; as your pull request commits will be squashed, with the PR subject becoming the commit that is used for generating the [changelog](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/releases) for the next release.

The pull request subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

If applied, this commit will _your subject line here_

For example:

* If applied, this commit will **refactor subsystem X for readability**
* If applied, this commit will **update getting started documentation**
* If applied, this commit will **remove deprecated methods**
* If applied, this commit will **release version 1.0.0**
* If applied, this commit will **merge pull request #123 from user/branch**

Notice how this doesn’t work for the other non-imperative forms:

* If applied, this commit will **fixed bug with Y**
* If applied, this commit will **change the behaviour of X**
* If applied, this commit will **more fixes for broken stuff**
* If applied, this commit will **sweet new API methods**

Below is an example of the subject line for a pull request:

**feat(alerts): add slack support to alerts**

**fix(csgoserver): remove SteamCMD auth requirement 32-bit workaround**

### 测试

#### 拉取请求状态检查
When a Pull Request is submitted, a series of status check tests are conducted.  These tests will asses the code quality, complete CI tests etc. To get your PR merged these status checks must pass.

#### 测试环境
It is recommended that you have a testing environment available to test your code during development. To test your own code you must change some variables within the `linuxgsm.sh` file. This will force the use of your own code branch.

```bash
## GitHub Branch Select
# Allows for the use of different function files
# from a different repo and/or branch.
githubuser="GameServerManagers"
githubrepo="LinuxGSM"
githubbranch="master"
```

### :wine_glass: 风格指南

#### Git 提交消息

LinuxGSM使用传统的提交标准，允许其他开发人员在开发时获得易于理解的描述性提交消息。虽然建议您在提交时使用此标准，但由于在合并 PR 时，您的提交最终会被压扁，因此此标准对于提交并不严格执行，但是，建议对于更复杂的提交使用此标准。

#### BASH 样式指南

LinuxGSM uses [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) to follow BASH best practices. It is recommended that you make use of linter tools for your text editor such as [linter-shellcheck](https://atom.io/packages/linter-shellcheck). LinuxGSM uses [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/manual/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/dashboard) to analyse any Pull Requests to give you feedback on code standards.

LinuxGSM also has some of its style standards that should be followed. These are available in the [dev docs](https://dev-docs.linuxgsm.com/)

## :blue_book: 文档贡献

除了代码贡献之外，还可以通过编写和改进文档来做出贡献。文档贡献也可以通过提交 Pull 请求来提交。

### 文档样式指南

LinuxGSM has various documentation available to assist [users](https://docs.linuxgsm.com) and [developers](dev-docs.linuxgsm.com). LinuxGSM primarily uses [GitBook](http://gitbook.com/) which uses the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) document standard. LinuxGSM uses [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/manual/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/dashboard) to analyse any Pull Requests to give you feedback on markup standards.
